# TheDiceSIm
# My first public repo.
This is able to roll a dice with the limit of 5 dice in gui format.

This project is divided into 3 instance:
I) It is a module format for the dice.
II) It is the textual version for the basic program without gui.
III)  It is the gui based program, It is compitable with only 5 dice( due to grafics limit ) at max but can be extended to more. 
To run the GUI mode download the code. The GIT HUB Codespace is not comitable with Kivy functionalities that I added.
